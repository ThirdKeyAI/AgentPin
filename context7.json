    "AgentPin uses ES256 (ECDSA P-256) exclusively — reject all other JWT algorithms; algorithm validation is inline with no external JWT crate in Rust",
    "Credential verification follows a 12-step flow: JWT parsing, algorithm check, signature verification, domain extraction, discovery resolution, domain binding, key matching, TOFU pinning, expiration, revocation, capability validation, delegation chain",
    "Discovery documents are published at /.well-known/agent-identity.json; revocation lists at /.well-known/agent-identity-revocations.json",
    "TOFU key pinning: on first verification for a domain, the public key (JWK thumbprint) is pinned — subsequent verifications reject different keys for the same domain",
    "Delegation chains must narrow capabilities, never widen them; chain depth limits are enforced",
    "Prefer short-lived credentials (hours, not days) — issue with TTL via CredentialBuilder (Rust), issueCredential (JS), or issue_credential (Python)",
    "Trust bundles package discovery + revocation data for offline/air-gapped environments — use 'agentpin-cli bundle' to create",
    "Rust crate is feature-gated: default is offline-capable, 'fetch' feature enables reqwest for online discovery",
    "Three crates: agentpin (core library), agentpin-cli (CLI binary), agentpin-server (Axum .well-known server)"
